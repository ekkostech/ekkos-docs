# Getting Started with ekkOS

Give your AI assistant persistent memory that works across sessions and tools.

## What You Get

- **Memory across sessions** - Your AI remembers context between conversations
- **Learned solutions** - Problems you solve become reusable patterns
- **Your preferences enforced** - Set MUST/NEVER/PREFER/AVOID rules that stick
- **Works everywhere** - Same memory across Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and more

## Prerequisites

- **Claude Code**, **Cursor**, or **Claude Desktop** installed
- Node.js 18+ (check: `node --version`)

## Quick Start

### Option A: VS Code Extension (Recommended)

1. Install [ekkOS Connect](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ekkostech.ekkos-connect) from the VS Code Marketplace
2. Click the ekkOS icon in the sidebar
3. Sign in with your ekkOS account
4. Click "Setup All"

The extension automatically configures Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and Claude Desktop.

### Option B: Manual Configuration

1. Get your API key from [platform.ekkos.dev](https://platform.ekkos.dev)
2. Follow the [Setup Guide](/docs/mcp-integration) for your specific tool

## Test Your Setup

In your AI assistant, try:

```
Search my memory for recent patterns
```

If ekkOS is connected, you'll see it use the `ekkOS_Search` tool.

## Create Your First Memory

Ask your AI:

```
I want to remember: Always use TypeScript strict mode in this project.
```

Your AI saves this as a directive. In future conversations, it will follow this rule.

## What Happens Automatically

As you work with your AI:

| What You Do | What ekkOS Does |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Solve a problem | Captures the solution for reuse |
| Say "always" or "never" | Saves it as a directive |
| Fix a bug | Remembers the fix |
| Get corrected | Updates its knowledge |

## Common Commands

Try these with your AI:

- "What did we discuss yesterday?" - Recall past conversations
- "How many patterns do I have?" - View your memory stats
- "Store my API key for GitHub" - Securely save credentials
- "Create a plan for implementing authentication" - Structure complex tasks

## Troubleshooting

### MCP Server Not Connecting

```bash
# Test connectivity
curl https://mcp.ekkos.dev/api/v1/health
# Should return: {"status":"ok","healthy":true}
```

### Tools Not Appearing

1. Restart your AI assistant after configuration changes
2. Verify your API key at [platform.ekkos.dev](https://platform.ekkos.dev)
3. Check your config file syntax (must be valid JSON)
