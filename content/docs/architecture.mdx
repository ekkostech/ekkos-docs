# How ekkOS Works

ekkOS provides persistent memory for AI coding assistants. Your AI remembers context, learns from experience, and respects your preferences across sessions.

## The Problem

AI assistants forget everything between sessions. Every conversation starts fresh:
- Re-explaining your codebase
- Repeating the same mistakes
- Ignoring your stated preferences

## The Solution

ekkOS gives your AI persistent memory stored in the cloud. It works with any MCP-compatible tool (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) and syncs across all of them.

## Cloud-Based Architecture

ekkOS is entirely cloud-based:

- **No local storage** - All memory lives in ekkOS servers
- **No local processing** - Pattern matching and retrieval happen server-side
- **Portable** - Your memory follows you across machines and tools
- **Secure** - Data encrypted at rest and in transit

The MCP server you install is a thin proxy that forwards requests to `mcp.ekkos.dev`.

## What Gets Remembered

### Patterns
Solutions that worked. When you solve a problem, ekkOS can capture it as a reusable pattern. Next time a similar problem arises, that solution is available.

### Directives
Your rules. When you say "always use TypeScript strict mode" or "never use the any type," these become directives your AI follows in future sessions.

### Conversations
Past context. You can recall what you discussed yesterday, last week, or whenever.

### Secrets
Credentials you store. API keys, tokens, and passwords are encrypted and available when needed.

## Memory Layers

ekkOS organizes memory into 11 layers:

| Layer | What It Stores |
|-------|---------------|
| Working | Current session context |
| Episodic | Past conversations |
| Semantic | Knowledge embeddings |
| Patterns | Proven solutions |
| Procedural | Step-by-step guides |
| Collective | Cross-user validated patterns |
| Meta | Pattern effectiveness data |
| Codebase | Project-specific context |
| Directives | Your MUST/NEVER/PREFER/AVOID rules |
| Conflict | Resolution data |
| Secrets | Encrypted credentials |

You don't interact with layers directly. The 29 MCP tools handle retrieval and storage automatically.

## How Learning Works

1. **You work normally** - Use your AI as usual
2. **Solutions are captured** - When you solve problems, they can become patterns
3. **Outcomes are tracked** - ekkOS notes what worked and what didn't
4. **Relevant memory surfaces** - Future queries find applicable past knowledge

This happens through the tools your AI calls, not through hidden background processing.

## What You Control

- **What gets saved** - You decide when to forge patterns or set directives
- **What gets retrieved** - Your AI searches memory when relevant
- **What gets deleted** - You can remove patterns, directives, or secrets
- **Who sees what** - Your memory is private to your account

## Limitations

- Memory requires your AI to actively use ekkOS tools
- Pattern quality depends on what you choose to save
- Retrieval finds relevant matches, not perfect ones
- You start with zero patterns and build over time
