# Confidence Signals™

Confidence Signals help you understand how well an AI suggestion aligns with your memory before you implement it.

## What It Does

When you receive a suggestion from your AI, ekkOS can check it against your stored patterns, directives, and past decisions. The result is a confidence signal that tells you:

- Does this match your past experience?
- Does this conflict with your rules?
- Is this something you've never encountered?

## The Three States

### Grounded ✅

The suggestion has supporting evidence in your memory.

**What this means:**
- Patterns exist that support this approach
- Past successful solutions align with this
- Your directives allow or encourage this

**How to interpret:** Higher confidence. The suggestion matches what has worked for you before.

---

### Speculative ⚠️

The suggestion has limited or no evidence in your memory.

**What this means:**
- No matching patterns found
- No relevant past conversations
- Neither confirmed nor contradicted by your memory

**How to interpret:** Neutral confidence. This may be valid, but you have no memory to support it. Proceed with normal caution.

---

### Conflicts ❌

The suggestion contradicts something in your memory.

**What this means:**
- A directive explicitly forbids this (NEVER rules)
- Past patterns indicate this approach failed
- This contradicts your stated preferences

**How to interpret:** Lower confidence. Review the conflicts before implementing.

---

## Using the ekkOS_Conflict Tool

Your AI can check suggestions before acting:

```
Check if using localStorage for tokens conflicts with my rules
```

This invokes `ekkOS_Conflict` and returns any matching directives or patterns that would be violated.

## Limitations

**Confidence Signals do not guarantee correctness.** They reflect alignment with your memory, not objective truth.

- **Grounded** doesn't mean "definitely correct"—it means it matches your past experience
- **Speculative** doesn't mean "wrong"—it means you have no prior data
- **Conflicts** may be intentional—you might be trying something new

The value is in surfacing relevant context, not in making decisions for you.

## When to Use

Confidence Signals are most valuable for:

- **Architectural decisions** - Does this match how we've built things before?
- **Technology choices** - Have we used this successfully in the past?
- **Configuration changes** - Does this violate any rules we've set?
- **Destructive operations** - Does this conflict with our safety directives?

## Setting Up Rules

To make Confidence Signals more useful, set directives:

```
I never want to use var in TypeScript
```

This creates a NEVER directive. Future suggestions using `var` will show a conflict.

```
I prefer Tailwind over CSS modules
```

This creates a PREFER directive. Suggestions using CSS modules will be flagged as potentially conflicting with preferences.
